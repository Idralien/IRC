## 🔍 Project Overview

This IRC server is a C++ implementation of the Internet Relay Chat protocol as specified in RFC 1459 and its extensions. It provides a platform for real-time text messaging, supporting multiple channels, private messaging, and various administrative commands.

**Key Features:**
- Multi-client support
- Channel management
- User authentication
- Command processing system
- Extensible architecture

## 🧩 Implementation Details

The server is built using C++98 standards, focusing on reliability and performance. The architecture follows object-oriented design principles with a clear separation of concerns:

- **Server Core**: Handles network connections, client registration, and message routing
- **Command System**: Processes and executes user commands
- **Entity Management**: Manages users, channels, and server state
- **Utilities**: Provides supporting functionality like logging and string manipulation
