# Internet Relay Chat (IRC)

## Overview
Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is a text-based communication protocol that facilitates real-time messaging. Created in 1988 by Jarkko Oikarinen, it remains a robust platform for group and private communication. See [[irc-protocol|IRC Protocol Overview]] for detailed protocol specifications.

## Our Implementation (IRC s19)

### Core Features
Our IRC server implementation ([[server-implementation|Server Implementation]]) provides:

- Real-time text communication
- Multiple channel support
- Private messaging system
- User authentication
- Channel operator privileges
- Extensive command system
- RFC 1459 compliance

### Technical Specifications
- **Server Name**: IRC s19
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Connection Limit**: 10 concurrent users
- **Default Port**: 6667
- **Implementation Language**: C++98
- **Architecture**: Event-driven, see [[architecture|System Architecture]]

### Security Features
- Server password protection
- Channel password support
- Operator privileges system
- Invite-only channels
- User authentication flow
- See [[entity-management|Entity Management]] for implementation details

### Channel System
Channels ([[channel-operations|Channel Operations]]) support:
- Dynamic creation
- Password protection
- User limits
- Topic management
- Operator privileges
- Invite-only mode
- User kick/ban functionality

### Command System
The server implements a comprehensive command system ([[command-system|Command System]]) including:
- Connection commands (PASS, NICK, USER)
- Channel operations (JOIN, PART, MODE)
- Communication commands (PRIVMSG, NOTICE)
- Administrative commands (KICK, INVITE)
- Server queries (PING, WHO)

See [[commands|Commands Reference]] for full command documentation.

### Message Processing
Messages are processed through a structured flow:
1. Reception and parsing
2. Command identification
3. Permission verification
4. Execution
5. Response generation

For details, see [[message-flow|Message Flow]].

### Numeric Responses
The server uses standardized numeric responses for:
- Error reporting
- Command acknowledgment
- Server information
- User information

See [[numeric-responses|Numeric Responses]] for the complete list.

## Usage Guidelines

### Getting Started
1. Server Connection
   - Connect to server (default port 6667)
   - Authenticate with PASS command
   - Set nickname and user information
   - See [[setup|Setup Guide]] for details

2. Channel Operations
   - Join existing channels
   - Create new channels
   - Set channel modes
   - Manage channel topics
   - See [[channel-operations|Channel Operations]]

3. Communication
   - Send channel messages
   - Send private messages
   - Use server commands
   - See [[commands|Commands Reference]]

### Best Practices
1. Connection Management
   - Always use proper registration sequence
   - Handle server responses appropriately
   - Maintain active connection with PING

2. Channel Management
   - Use appropriate channel modes
   - Maintain channel operator status
   - Handle user privileges properly

3. Message Handling
   - Follow protocol message format
   - Handle errors gracefully
   - Respect rate limits
